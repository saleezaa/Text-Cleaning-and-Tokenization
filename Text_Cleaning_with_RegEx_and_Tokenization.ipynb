The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \\\"nuclear dumpsite\\\".\\n \\n Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \\\"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\\\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\\n \\n Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to \\u00c2\\u00a3680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: \\\"I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. \\\"Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. \\\"This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the \\u00c2\\u00a348bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. \\\"The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. \\\"The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Wales coach elated with win\\n \\n Mike Ruddock paid tribute to his Wales side after they came from 15-6 down to beat France 24-18 in the Six Nations.\\n \\n \\\"After going two tries down in 12 minutes we had to show character,\\\" said the national team coach. \\\"I didn't have to tell them anything at half-time because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before. \\\"They decided they didn't want to do that again and came out fighting. It was a great team effort and we showed great character to come back.\\\" Man-of-the-match Stephen Jones, who kicked three penalties, a drop goal and conversion, was ecstatic following after the win at Stade de France.\\n \\n \\\"It's just a special moment. Two years ago we didn't win a single game in the Six Nations. But we're a very happy camp now,\\\" he said. \\\"We worked hard as a squad and I'm a proud Welshman. We've got hard matches to come, so we're just happy with the start.\\\" Double try scorer Martyn Williams was keen not to talk about a possible Grand Slam for Wales. \\\"We've got more self-belief these days. Two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early. \\\"There's no mention of a Grand Slam among the players. We've got a tough game against Scotland at Murrayfield. They could bring us crashing down to earth.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Labour attacked on Howard poster\\n \\n Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.\\n \\n The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: \\\"I can spend the same money twice.\\\" The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory. Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: \\\"2+2=5\\\".\\n \\n The hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver! There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members. It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday. Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about \\\"personalised abusive campaigning\\\". Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: \\\"It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches.\\\"\\n \\n Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. \\\"Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,\\\" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. \\\"Whatever the idea is, I think it's a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning.\\\" Mr Temko said he blamed \\\"cock-up not conspiracy\\\", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.\\n \\n The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued. \\\"Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme... is that the Tories are trying to con you.\\\" A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. \\\"This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,\\\" he said. But a Conservative spokeswoman said: \\\"This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour's campaign team.\\\"\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. Sitting on Wednesday, three Appeal Court judges dismissed both appeals. They were challenging decisions by two judges in the High Court in February this year. It followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to RAF Fairford and forced to return to London under police escort. The demonstrators appealed against a finding by Lord Justice May and Mr Justice Harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.\\n \\n The police were urging Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices Clarke and Rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. Craig Mackey, assistant chief constable of Gloucestershire Police, said: \\\"We have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence.\\\" He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields. \\\"Given these circumstances, and the fact that RAF Fairford, and other military installations in the UK, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. \\\"From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford.\\\" Fairford Coach Action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Their action is supported by Amnesty International and Liberty.\\n\",\n          \"O'Leary agrees new Villa contract\\n \\n Aston Villa boss David O'Leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on Thursday, securing his future at the club until summer 2008.\\n \\n O'Leary's future was in question, but Villa chairman Doug Ellis said he was happy to secure the deal. \\\"David's record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board's amibitions in taking this club forward,\\\" he told Villa's website. \\\"For this reason it was important we got this right.\\\" O'Leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men Roy Aitken and Steve McGregor. \\\"It was important to me Roy and Steve, an integral part of my team, should stay for the same time,\\\" O'Leary said on Thursday ahead of signing his new deal. \\\"Someone has to try and put Aston Villa back where they should belong and I'm up for the challenge.\\\"Earlier in December, there were rumours O'Leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.\\n \\n But he denied that, saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving Villa's fortunes in the long term. \\\"I want to make sure by the end of the five years I would have been in charge that Villa are achieving top six finishes in the Premiership on a regular basis,\\\" said O'Leary, who took over at Villa Park in May 2003. \\\"But to achieve that, and take the next step forward, we do need to bring in quality players. \\\"I would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.\\\" Meanwhile, O'Leary has rapped skipper Olof Mellberg for his comments before Sunday's derby with Birmingham.\\n \\n Mellberg spoke of his dislike of Villa's rivals ahead of the match, which Steve Bruce's side won 2-1. \\\"I've had more than a quiet word with Olof. It's been said within the whole group, not as a one-to-one,\\\" he told Villa's website. \\\"You shouldn't leave yourself open to be shot down. You shouldn't give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Labour in constituency race row\\n \\n Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group.\\n \\n Local councillor Lyn Brown was selected for West Ham, east London, in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women. An Operation Black Vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet Labour party chairman Ian McCartney for discussions. Mr McCartney recently announced party consultation on all-black shortlists. However, Labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the West Ham result.\\n \\n Ashok Vishwanathan of Operation Black Vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected. \\\"I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates,\\\" Mr Vishwanathan said.\\n \\n Last month the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances. A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. \\\"We will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward,\\\" the spokesman said. Ethnic minorities make up 8% of the United Kingdom population but only 2% of MPs - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group. Twelve of them represent Labour, and one is a Liberal Democrat. If ethnic minorities were represented in the House of Commons in proportion to their numbers in the population, there would be 42 ethnic minority MPs.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

ninth budget charles kennedy has said how was it right that the poorest 20 of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20 the lib dem leader asked the new 200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the unfair tax he added the government could not go on patching up the system he added speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a 200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than 450 a year with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off on pensions mr kennedy said it was a scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children he said a residency criteria would end at a stroke this fundamental iniquity mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long term care for the elderly abolishing top up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50 income tax to those earning more than 100 000 per annum he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election for most individuals most families most households it adds up to exactly the same thing said mr kennedy and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election\",\n          \"moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville moya made up for missing spain s 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 6 2 7 6 7 1 7 6 7 5 to give the hosts an unassailable 3 1 lead i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what i have lived today i do not think i will live again spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed it s really incredible to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played a great game it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles aged 18 years and 185 days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay courters in the world said the american i had my chances and just didn t convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and

charging 50 income tax to those earning more than 100 000 per annum he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election for most individuals most families most households it adds up to exactly the same thing said mr kennedy and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election\",\n          \"moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville moya made up for missing spain s 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 6 2 7 6 7 1 7 6 7 5 to give the hosts an unassailable 3 1 lead i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what i have lived today i do not think i will live again spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed it s really incredible to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played a great game it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles aged 18 years and 185 days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay courters in the world said the american i had my chances and just didn t convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and they beat us it s as simple as that\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
